# 📚 Day 1 - JavaScript

## ⏳ Duration
3 hours of focused study.

## 🚀 What I learned
- Everything in JS runs inside an **Execution Context** which has two parts:
  - **Memory Creation Phase** (Variable Environment)
  - **Code Execution Phase** (Thread of Execution)
- JavaScript is a **synchronous, single-threaded language** — code runs one line at a time in order.

### 🔥 Call Stack
- Maintains the execution of functions.
- Handles creation, execution, and deletion of function calls.

### 🔍 Function Invocation & Variable Environment
- How functions are invoked and how their variable environment is set up.
- The shortest valid JavaScript program is simply an empty file.

### 🌐 Global Context
- What is the **`window`** object and the **`this`** keyword in the global scope.
- Understanding **global space**.

### ⚠️ Undefined vs Not Defined
- `undefined`: variable declared but not assigned.
- `not defined`: variable was never declared.

### 🧩 Loosely Typed Language
- Variables can hold any type at any time.

### 🗺️ Scope & Lexical Environment
- Scope defines where variables/functions are accessible.
- Lexical Environment is created along with execution context and maintains the hierarchy.

### 🔗 Scope Chaining
- How JavaScript resolves variable references using the chain of lexical environments.

## 💡 Reflection
Today was foundational. Learned how JS engine works under the hood which will help me debug and write better code later.
